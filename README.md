# Anomaly Detection
This project focuses on surface anomaly detection and segmentation by leveraging advanced techniques such as fine-tuning pretrained models, UNet architectures, and the [Anomalib library](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib). The primary goal is to accurately detect and localize defects on surfaces, a crucial task for ensuring quality control in industrial applications.

## Key Contributions

- Fine-tuned pretrained models tailored specifically for surface anomaly detection  
- UNet-based segmentation models enabling precise localization of defects  
- Integration of the [Anomalib library](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib), a modular and extensible framework for anomaly detection  
- Development of a combined detection and segmentation pipeline to enhance overall accuracy  
- Extensive experiments and evaluations conducted on various surface defect datasets 

## Project Overview
Surface anomaly detection and segmentation are vital components of automated quality assurance systems in manufacturing. While traditional methods often fail to detect subtle or complex defects, deep learning techniques provide more robust and accurate results. This project combines fine-tuned pretrained models with UNet-based segmentation, enabling both effective detection and precise localization of anomalies across different surface types.
